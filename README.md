# insta-keras

Keras demos and experiments using [Instacart data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis).

I'm learning Keras and TensorFlow, with a focus on recommendation-related problems, and created this repo to store my experiments along the way.

## Order size prediction

See the [order_size_prediction](order_size_prediction) subdirectory.

This is a really simplified toy example for my [Applied AI talk](https://www.meetup.com/AppliedAI/events/241111330/).

The idea is, given a user's previous order, can we predict how many items from it they will reorder in their next order?
